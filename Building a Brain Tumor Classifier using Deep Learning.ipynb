    "### Introduction\n",
    "Deep learning has paved its roots much more decisively in our daily lives. As a society, we experience miniature lifestyle changes, such as self-driving cars, Google Assistant, Netflix recommendations, spam email detection, and many more. Similarly, deep learning has also evolved in healthcare, where we use deep learning models to detect brain tumors using MRI scans, detect covid using lung x-rays, etc.\n",
    "A brain tumor is a serious disease with more than 1 million cases recorded annually.\n",
    "\n",
    "A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is used if a person has a brain tumor. A brain tumor can belong to any category, and an MRI examination of these millions of people to decide whether a person is suffering from this disease or not, and if so, what is his category, can be a difficult task. This is where deep learning models play a vital role, where it can decide whether a patient has a brain tumor or not just by providing an MRI image of the patient’s brain using neural networks.\n",

We all have the vision to improve this technology every step of the way and make it useful for everyday life. Using Deep Learning in healthcare is the best option. Like the above Deep Learning model for brain tumor classification, we can use these models in every sector by applying certain modifications.\n",
